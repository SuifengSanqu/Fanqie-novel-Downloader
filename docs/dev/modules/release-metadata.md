# Release Metadata Normalizer

## Responsibility

`scripts/normalize-updater-metadata.py` prepares Tauri's `latest.json` for a
public GitHub Release. It resolves each updater asset ID through the release
asset list and rewrites GitHub API asset URLs to unauthenticated browser
download URLs.

The authenticated asset `name` is the URL authority. Draft assets expose an
ephemeral `releases/download/untagged-*` browser URL, so the normalizer never
copies `browser_download_url`; it percent-encodes the matched name beneath the
requested repository and final tag instead.

## Workflow

1. Download the draft release metadata and its asset list.
2. Validate the repository and tag, then resolve every platform entry by asset
   ID or an exact asset name.
3. Reject signatures, `latest.json`, missing signatures, and missing assets
   when they are selected as update packages.
4. Write the normalized metadata and run `--check` before publishing.

`发布 / 维护工具` 工作流的 `repair-updater-metadata` 操作会对已有 Release 复用
同一脚本，因此 URL 错误可以在不重新构建安装包的情况下修复。

## Verification

`tests/test_normalize_updater_metadata.py` covers API-to-browser URL conversion,
draft `untagged-*` URLs, missing assets, signature mis-selection, and idempotent
checks. `tests/test_release_workflow.py` checks the workflow integration.
